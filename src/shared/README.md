# Shared Models and Contracts

## Overview
This directory contains shared DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), validation models, and common types used across:
- SPFx Client (`/src/client-spfx`)
- Blazor Portal (`/src/portal-blazor`)
- Backend API (`/src/api-dotnet`)

## Structure
```
/src/shared
├── models/           # Shared data models
├── contracts/        # API contracts and interfaces
├── validation/       # Common validation rules
└── constants/        # Shared constants and enums
```

## Usage
This ensures consistency across the entire application stack and reduces code duplication.

Coming in future issues.
